            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <h2>Non-English speaking migrants struggle to use Westpac Digital banking due to its complexity and language barriers.<br><br>
            This leads to low digital adoption, increased branch visits and poor NPS in a significant sector, as migrants are forecasted to contribute
            $1.6 trillion to Australian GDP by 2050.</h2>

            <h4>research</h4>
            <h2>We interviewed the Samoan community (30+) and contacted family and friends from the Korean, Vietnamese and Chinese community.
            In addition to this, we spoke to Kogarah branch staff.<br><br>
            We found these common themes: the app is overwhelming and too complex; banking language is confounding, which is exacerbated by language barriers;
            and, reputation, trust and word of mouth are deciding factors when choosing who to bank with.<br><br>
            This was reinforced by Effie, Kogarah’s branch manager, who was not able to meet her targets to digitally onboard 90% of customers as they would find the app too complex after they were set up,
            becoming discouraged and ending up back in branches.</h2>

            <h4>data</h4>
            <h2>In addition to interviews, we also did some qualitative and quantitative research, discovering that main migrant demographics
            in Australia were: China, India, New Zealand and UK.<br><br>
            We also found that: approximately 28% of our population was born overseas, growing by 260000 in 2017 alone; 1 in 3 small businesses are owned by migrants; and 40% of Choice account sales to our New
            To Bank customers are to migrants.<br><br>
            We also only capture 12% of migrant customers compared to CBA’s acquisition rate of 52%.<br><br>
            All this signals an increasing demand for both customer and business products, and we have an opportunity to meet this demand.</h2>

            <h4>Key outcomes</h4>
            <h2>Our idea was to simplify banking for the migrant sector so that it was:<br><br>
              - Less reliant on branches<br>
              - Less complex<br>
              - Recognising cultural differences<br>
              - Streamlining features<br>
              - Empowering<br>
              - Encouraging independence</h2>

            <h4>Our solution</h4>
            <h2>Introducing Lexi… a simple mode in the existing Westpac mobile apps, akin to the current travel mode, where we streamline
            our features to meet the needs of non-English speaking customers.<br><br>
            Lexi is a personalised experience, distilling the sometimes overwhelming amount of choice the customer has to just a few key options. Being a mode in Westpac Live for mobile means we
            leverage existing security infrastructure, technology and fraud prevention controls to ensure we maintain Westpac’s high
            standards.<br><br>
            Lexi aims to empower migrant customers to complete everyday banking tasks with ease and independence. We want
            these customers to stay with us long enough to spread the word that "My bank understands me and I understand my bank" in
            whatever language they choose to use.</h2>
